Conservationists have focused on captive breeding as a primary strategy to save the Yangtze giant softshell turtle. In 2008, the last known fertile female, housed at the Changsha Zoo, was transferred to the Suzhou Zoo to breed with the sole known male in captivity. Despite six breeding seasons and numerous eggs laid, no viable offspring were produced.[22]

In 2015, artificial insemination was attempted for the first time. Although the procedure successfully fertilized eggs, none hatched. The female died in April 2019 after another artificial insemination attempt.[12][13]

To improve future breeding outcomes, conservationists have focused on better habitat conditions and dietary adjustments to increase calcium levels, which are believed to influence egg viability.[30]

Wild population monitoring In parallel with captive breeding, efforts to locate wild individuals have intensified. Surveys in Vietnam's Dong Mo and Xuan Khanh Lakes have identified potential survivors, though their numbers remain critically low. Conservationists continue to explore other areas, such as the Red River in Yunnan Province, for remaining specimens.
