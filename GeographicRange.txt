The Yangtze giant softshell turtle historically inhabited the Yangtze River and Lake Tai, located on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in eastern China, as well as areas in southern China, including Gejiu, Yuanyang, Jianshui, and Honghe in Yunnan Province.[17]

Two specimens captured from Gejiu in the 1970s were kept at the Beijing Zoo and the Shanghai Zoo but died in 2005 and 2006, respectively.

In Vietnam, the species has been observed in Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi on several occasions, including documented sightings in 1999, 2000, and 2005.[18] The turtle captured from the lake in April 2011, which was treated for open sores potentially caused by pollution, injuries from fishing hooks, or other turtles, was later found dead in January 2016.[19][20]

In recent years, individuals have been identified in Dong Mo Lake and Xuan Khanh Lake in Vietnam. A turtle discovered in Dong Mo Lake in 2020 was confirmed to be female, but it died in April 2023. Another individual of unspecified gender is thought to inhabit the same lake, while an additional turtle is believed to live in Xuan Khanh Lake.
