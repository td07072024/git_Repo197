Currently, only two or three living individuals of the Yangtze giant softshell turtle are known to exist: one in captivity in China and one or two in the wild in Vietnam.[11]

The species' decline has been marked by significant losses in recent years. A wild individual in Vietnam was reported dead in January 2016, and the last captive female at the Suzhou Zoo in China died in April 2019 following an artificial insemination attempt.[12][13]

In October 2020, a wild female was discovered in Dong Mo Lake in Vietnam, giving conservationists renewed hope. However, this individual was found dead in early 2023, further diminishing the species' chances of survival.[14]

An additional individual is believed to have been sighted in the same area, though its exact status remains uncertain. The known surviving turtles are thought to include one at the Suzhou Zoo and potentially one in the nearby Xuan Khanh Lake.
