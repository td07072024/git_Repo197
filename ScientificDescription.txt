The Yangtze giant softshell turtle was first described in 1873 by John Edward Gray, a turtle expert at the British Museum, who named it Oscaria swinhoei after English biologist Robert Swinhoe, who had sent a specimen from Shanghai. Gray described the species as "the most beautiful species of Trionychidae that has yet occurred."[25]

In 1880, Pierre Marie Heude, a Shanghai-based Jesuit missionary, obtained multiple specimens of the species from the Huangpu River and Lake Tai. Believing the specimens exhibited significant variation, he described them as five distinct species: Yuen leprosus, Yuen maculatus, Yuen elegans, Yuen viridis, and Yuen pallens. The genus name Yuen derives from the Chinese é¼‹ (yuan), meaning "large turtle." Later, zoologists reclassified the species under different genera, including Trionyx, Pelodiscus, and Pelochelys. In 1987, Peter Andre Meylan placed the species under the genus Rafetus.[26]

The taxonomic status of the closely related Hoan Kiem turtle (Rafetus leloii) remains controversial. While most herpetologists consider R. leloii a junior synonym of Rafetus swinhoei, some Vietnamese biologists, such as Ha Dinh Duc and Le Tran Binh, argue that it is a distinct species based on genetic and morphological differences. Critics, including Farkas et al., have attributed these differences to age-related variation and noted that the genetic data used by Le et al. were not submitted to GenBank. They also criticized the violation of ICZN Code rules when renaming R. leloii as R. vietnamensis.
