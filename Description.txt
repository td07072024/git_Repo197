The Yangtze giant softshell turtle is recognized for its deep head, pig-like snout, and dorsally positioned eyes. As a critically endangered species, it is widely regarded as the largest freshwater turtle in the world.[4] Although comparisons are limited due to the small number of known specimens, its average and maximum sizes surpass those of other large freshwater turtles, such as the alligator snapping turtle and related giant softshell species, including other Rafetus and Pelochelys species.[5]

Adult specimens exceed 100 cm (39 in) in length and 70 cm (28 in) in width, with weights ranging from 70–100 kg (150–220 lb).[6] A study of large turtles from the Yangtze River reported an average weight of 25 kg (55 lb), although not all specimens were definitively identified as Rafetus.[7]

The turtle’s carapace (shell) typically measures over 50 cm (20 in), with the largest recorded at 86 cm (34 in) in straight length. Curved carapace lengths of up to 106 cm (42 in) have also been reported. Exceptional specimens, primarily from Vietnam, are believed to have weighed between 220 to 247.5 kg (485 to 546 lb).[8][9] The head measures over 20 cm (7.9 in) in length and 10 cm (3.9 in) in width.

Sexual dimorphism is present, with males generally smaller than females but possessing longer, more prominent tails.
